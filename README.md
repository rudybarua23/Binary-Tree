Balanced Binary Search Tree Implementation

This project is an implementation of a Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST) in JavaScript. The BST provides common operations such as insertion, deletion, finding values, and different types of tree traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order, and level-order). The tree is kept balanced to ensure that search, insertion, and deletion operations are efficient and maintain an average time complexity of O(log n).

Key features of this project include:

Balanced Tree Construction: Builds a balanced binary search tree from a sorted array to ensure optimal depth.

Insertion and Deletion: Methods to insert and delete nodes while maintaining the BST properties.

Self-Rebalancing: Includes a method to rebalance the tree if it becomes unbalanced after insertions or deletions.

Traversal Methods: In-order, pre-order, post-order, and level-order traversals are implemented, each allowing for a callback function to process each node.

Visual Representation: A prettyPrint function is provided to visually represent the structure of the tree, which helps in debugging and understanding the tree's shape.

Height and Balance Checking: Functions to calculate the height of a node and determine whether the tree is balanced, ensuring efficient operations.
